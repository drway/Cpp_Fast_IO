# Cpp_Fast_IO
Cpp Fast IO Templates by drway.

The code is under MPL 2.0 Licence.

This template is used for competitive programming, for a faster read in and print out speed.

Need C++ 11 Support.

## Functions

* ```redi()``` is used to read in integers. You can use it like ```redi(a,b,c,...)``` . It uses variadic templates so your compiler must support C++ 11 or later version of C++.
* ```getchar()``` is a macro defined to get a character using the function ```fread()``` . (It is not the function defined in cstdio/stdio.h !)
* ```wrtn()``` is used to write an integer. You can use it like ```wrtn(a)``` .
* ```wrti()``` is used to write an integer and feed the line. You can use it like ```wrti(a)``` .

**ATTENTION: You MUST use ```flush()``` after output!**

# Functions need to be added

* read in a string
* print a string
